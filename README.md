# Numerical Optimization (CS215300) Assignment 1
## Introduction
In this assignment, we expect you to be familiar with optimization library, the numerical calculation package 'SciPy'. We are using the Rosenbrock function as the benchmark of our optimization algorithms. Rosenbrock is a simple fourth-order function has the minimal point at [1,1]. We provide a visualization function which draws the contour.

## Tasks (Briefly)

- Apply SciPy library of the optimization algorithm of BFGS, Conjugate gradient, Modified Newton's method with conjugate gradient with the initilal guess [-2,2].

- Gradient descent is not included in SciPy package, "Gradient descent with optimal step length" is implemented.

- Newton's method is not included in SciPy package, "Pure Newton's method" is implemented.


# Numerical Optimization (CS215300) Assignment 2
## Introduction
In this assignment, we expect you to be familiar with the Pytorch optimizer library. We are using the Rosenbrock function as the benchmark of our optimization algorithms again. Since this is a simple test on very small scale, CUDA is not needed. You need to install Pytorch to acquire the pre-defined optimizers.  


## Tasks (Briefly)

- Try different optimizers and observe the behavior of them, and try different hyperparameters and observe if they behave differently.

- justifying whether if the setting converges or not by experiment or your hyperthesis.


# Numerical Optimization (CS215300) Assignment 3
## Introduction
In this assignment, we expect you to be able to solve constrained optimization problem by Scipy library. We want you to apply two algorithms on the following problem as benchmark, survey the method used in these libraries, and analysis the behaviour of these algorithms.


## Tasks (Briefly)
- solving the optmization problem by using trust-constr method:

- Using COBYLA method to solve the same problem.
